# Facade
- Exposing several components through a single interface
- Balancing complexity and presentation/useability
- Provides a simple, easy to understand, user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code
- Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes

## Motivation
- i.e. a house has many subsystems
    - Complex internal structures: electricity, plumbing, floors
    - The end user is not exposed to internals
- The consumers of the software want a simple API interface
